# airbnb-clone-project

## 📌 Overview

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. The project emphasizes **backend systems**, **database design**, **API development**, and **application security**, providing learners with hands-on experience in building scalable and secure applications.

This project is part of my **ALX Pro Backend Development program**, serving as a capstone-style learning experience to apply backend engineering concepts in a practical environment.

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Build a functional **Airbnb-like booking platform** from the ground up.
* Gain practical experience in **full-stack development**, with focus on backend systems.
* Design and implement a **relational database schema** to support bookings, users, listings, and reviews.
* Develop a **RESTful API** for user authentication, listings management, and reservations.
* Implement **security best practices** including authentication, authorization, and input validation.
* Understand **scalable architectures** and collaborative team workflows.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Backend Framework:** Python (Flask / FastAPI / Django — depending on scope)
* **Database:** MySQL / PostgreSQL
* **ORM:** SQLAlchemy / Django ORM
* **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication & session management
* **API:** RESTful API endpoints
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub (for collaboration and CI/CD integration)
* **Testing:** Unit & integration testing with pytest/unittest
* **Containerization (optional):** Docker for consistent environment setup
* **Deployment (future scope):** AWS / Heroku / Render

## 🚀 Features (Planned)

* User registration and authentication
* Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for listings
* Booking and reservation system
* Search and filter functionality for listings
* User reviews and ratings
* Secure handling of user data and sessions
