## 🗃️ Database Design

Below are the core entities and how they relate in an Airbnb-style booking platform. This design prioritizes data integrity, performance, and clear ownership links.

### Entities & Key Fields

#### 1) Users

* **id** (PK, UUID/int): unique user identifier
* **full\_name** (string): user’s display name
* **email** (string, unique): login/communication
* **password\_hash** (string): securely stored credential
* **role** (enum: `guest`, `host`, `admin`): access/permissions

#### 2) Properties

* **id** (PK): unique property identifier
* **host\_id** (FK → Users.id): owner/host of the listing
* **title** (string): listing headline
* **address** (JSON or structured fields): street, city, state, country, lat/long
* **price\_per\_night** (decimal): base nightly rate

#### 3) Bookings

* **id** (PK): unique booking identifier
* **guest\_id** (FK → Users.id): who booked
* **property\_id** (FK → Properties.id): which listing
* **check\_in / check\_out** (date): stay duration
* **status** (enum: `pending`, `confirmed`, `canceled`, `completed`)

#### 4) Reviews

* **id** (PK): unique review identifier
* **booking\_id** (FK → Bookings.id): ties review to a completed stay
* **author\_id** (FK → Users.id): reviewer (guest or host)
* **rating** (int 1–5): score
* **comment** (text): feedback

#### 5) Payments

* **id** (PK): unique payment identifier
* **booking\_id** (FK → Bookings.id): what this payment is for
* **amount** (decimal): charged total
* **currency** (string, e.g., `NGN`, `USD`)
* **status** (enum: `initiated`, `authorized`, `captured`, `refunded`, `failed`)

> **Optional supporting tables (recommended for production):**
> `PropertyImages(id, property_id, url, is_primary)`, `Amenities(id, name)`, `PropertyAmenities(property_id, amenity_id)`, `Wishlists(user_id, property_id)`, `Payouts(host_id, amount, status)`.

---

### Relationships (Cardinality & Ownership)

* **User ↔ Properties:**

  * **One (host) → Many (properties)**: A user with role `host` can create multiple properties.
  * `Properties.host_id` → `Users.id`.

* **User ↔ Bookings:**

  * **One (guest) → Many (bookings)**: A guest can make many bookings over time.
  * `Bookings.guest_id` → `Users.id`.

* **Property ↔ Bookings:**

  * **One (property) → Many (bookings)**: A property can have many bookings across dates.
  * `Bookings.property_id` → `Properties.id`.
  * **Business rule:** enforce non-overlapping date ranges per property.

* **Booking ↔ Reviews:**

  * **One (booking) → One (review) per reviewer type**: Typically one guest review per completed booking; optionally a host review (if supported).
  * `Reviews.booking_id` → `Bookings.id`.
  * **Business rule:** only allow reviews after `check_out` and when booking `status = completed`.

* **Booking ↔ Payments:**

  * **One (booking) → One/Many (payments)**: Usually one captured payment; may include refunds or partial captures.
  * `Payments.booking_id` → `Bookings.id`.

* **User (host) ↔ Payouts (optional):**

  * **One (host) → Many (payouts)**: Aggregate completed bookings minus fees → payouts to host.

---

### Notes on Integrity & Indexing

* **Unique constraints:** `Users.email`, optionally `(property_id, check_in, check_out)` overlap checks via exclusion/constraints at app or DB level.
* **Indexes:**

  * `Bookings(property_id, check_in, check_out)` for availability searches
  * `Properties(host_id)`, `Bookings(guest_id)`, `Reviews(booking_id)`, `Payments(booking_id)`
  * Geo/FTS indexes if searching by location or text.

---

### Example ER Tips (non-exhaustive)

* **Cascade rules:**

  * Deleting a **User** who is a **host** should be restricted if they own properties; soft-delete instead.
  * Deleting a **Booking** should restrict if a **Payment** exists; use refunds + status changes rather than deletes.
* **Security:** never store raw card data; integrate a PCI-compliant provider and persist only tokens/IDs.
* **Auditing:** add `created_at`, `updated_at`, and optional `deleted_at` to all tables.

---

## 🔒 API Security

Building a booking platform means handling sensitive data (identities, payment intents, availability). This project follows defense‑in‑depth with multiple controls across authentication, authorization, transport, storage, and runtime.

### Core Measures

* **Authentication**

  * **JWT access + refresh tokens** (short‑lived access, rotating refresh); optional cookie-based sessions for web.
  * **Password hashing** with Argon2 or bcrypt; email verification & optional MFA.
  * **Brute‑force protection** (login attempt throttling, account lockouts with safe recovery).

* **Authorization (RBAC & Ownership)**

  * Role-based access control: `guest`, `host`, `admin`.
  * Ownership checks on resources (e.g., hosts can only mutate their own properties; guests only their bookings).
  * Scoped endpoints and least-privilege service accounts.

* **Input Validation & Output Encoding**

  * Centralized request validation (e.g., Pydantic/FastAPI or serializers in Django).
  * Strict types, length limits, whitelist enums; sanitize user-generated content; safe error messages.

* **Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention**

  * Global and per‑IP limits (e.g., 60 req/min), stricter on auth & search endpoints.
  * Bot/abuse detection signals; pagination caps; file upload size/type checks.

* **Transport Security**

  * **TLS-only** (HTTPS) everywhere; strict redirects; HSTS; no mixed content.
  * Secure cookie flags (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`).

* **Data Protection at Rest**

  * Encrypt secrets and sensitive fields (e.g., payment tokens) at rest.
  * Never store raw card data—use a PCI-compliant payment provider; store only provider tokens/IDs.

* **CORS & Security Headers**

  * Restrictive CORS (explicit origins, methods, headers).
  * Secure headers: `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`.

* **Secrets & Config Management**

  * Environment variables (no secrets in code); secret rotation policy.
  * Separate configs per environment; principle of least privilege for DB/users.

* **Logging, Monitoring & Auditing**

  * Structured logs (no PII, no secrets); correlation IDs per request.
  * Audit trails for auth events, payouts, booking state changes.
  * Alerting on anomalies (auth failures spikes, 5xx bursts).

* **Dependency & Supply Chain Security**

  * Pin & regularly update dependencies; vulnerability scanning (e.g., `pip-audit`, `npm audit` if applicable).
  * Integrity checks in CI; signed container images (if using Docker).

* **Backups & Recovery**

  * Automated encrypted DB backups; periodic restore drills.
  * Idempotent payment webhooks and replay protection (signatures + timestamps).

* **OWASP Top 10 Coverage**

  * Prevent injection (ORM parameterization), broken auth (short‑lived tokens), sensitive data exposure (TLS+encryption),
    SSRF/XXE (safe parsers), security misconfig (infra as code checks), and more.

### Why Security Is Crucial (by Area)

* **Protecting User Data**
  Personally identifiable information (PII) and account credentials must remain confidential and tamper‑proof to maintain user trust and comply with regulations.

* **Securing Payments**
  Payment flows are prime fraud targets; strict provider tokenization, signed webhooks, and audit trails prevent theft, double charging, and chargeback abuse.

* **Preserving Booking Integrity**
  Accurate availability and non‑overlapping reservations require strong authorization and idempotent operations to prevent race conditions and manipulation.

* **Platform Reliability & Abuse Control**
  Rate limits, monitoring, and anomaly detection keep the API performant and resilient against scraping, DoS, and brute‑force attacks.

* **Operational Safety**
  Proper secrets management, least privilege, backups, and tested recovery plans reduce blast radius and speed up remediation when incidents occur.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

**Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** are practices that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications.

* **CI (Continuous Integration):** Ensures that every new code change is automatically built, tested, and validated before merging into the main branch.
* **CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery):** Automates the release process so that changes can be reliably deployed to staging or production environments with minimal manual intervention.

### Why It Matters for This Project

* **Consistency:** Ensures that the Airbnb Clone application behaves the same across development, staging, and production.
* **Faster Feedback:** Automated tests catch bugs early, reducing the risk of deploying broken code.
* **Scalability:** Enables the project to handle more features and contributors without compromising quality.
* **Reliability:** Automates repetitive tasks, reduces human error, and ensures stable releases.

### Tools & Technologies

* **GitHub Actions:** Automates builds, tests, and deployment workflows directly from GitHub.
* **Docker:** Provides containerization to ensure consistent environments across development and production.
* **pytest/unittest:** For running automated unit and integration tests.
* **Heroku / Render / AWS:** Deployment targets for staging and production environments.
* **SonarQube / CodeQL (optional):** For static code analysis and security scanning.
