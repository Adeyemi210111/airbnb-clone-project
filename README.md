# airbnb-clone-project

## 📌 Overview

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. The project emphasizes **backend systems**, **database design**, **API development**, and **application security**, providing learners with hands-on experience in building scalable and secure applications.

This project is part of my **ALX Pro Backend Development program**, serving as a capstone-style learning experience to apply backend engineering concepts in a practical environment.
